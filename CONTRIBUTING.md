- Success: Green tones
- Warning: Amber tones
- Error: Red tones (used sparingly)

### Typography
- Clear, readable fonts
- Sufficient line spacing
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Mobile-friendly text sizes

## 💻 Coding Standards

### JavaScript/React
```javascript
// Use functional components with hooks
function Component({ prop1, prop2 }) {
  const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
  
  // Use descriptive variable names
  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    // Handle form submission
  };
  
  return (
    <div className="component-container">
      {/* JSX content */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default Component;
```

### CSS/Tailwind
- Use Tailwind utilities when possible
- Create custom CSS for complex animations
- Follow BEM naming for custom classes
- Ensure responsive design

### File Organization
```
